1zOPtQNChZM,"I love how excited you sound about our little island!! Santorini is very unique but if you enjoyed it you should definetly come back to see other places. Kyklades have many to offer but they are in a way all the same, so I would suggest to visit Agistri, Spetses, Corfu or Samothraki. I hope you didn't have any unpleasant experience, because Greek businessman in islands usally overcharge foreign tourists. Btw Aslan mispronounced Oia but he did it in a very cute way 😛 Anywayy love you and you both looked beautiful in your matching outfits and your sunsetie light ❤",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"I think the critic DIDNT understand a movie/. Lets be honest Horror genre especially last 20 years TOTALLY SUCK.  Causes? Horror genre DIDNT combine with other genres like romantic or comedy and that's why watching modern horror movie is boring. Directors of horror movies focused to scare audience not to tell an interesting story. That's why IT 2017 doesn't focused on Pennywise, the director Musketi wanted to tell a story instead making jumpscare clip. He focused uncovering protagonists friendship who is who and their are afraid of. Pennywise is used for uniting all aspects to visualizate nightmares. And main mistake of critic is critize that Pennywise is funny. Holy f*ck.  Critic. That's why everyone love Pennywise, cause he is funny really funny. I don't know about old version Pennywise but THAT Pennywise is FUNNY/ How about that doors Scary, Very Scary, Not so scary at all? Pennywise is an epic troll. That's why dancing scene is EPIC.

That, and giving Ben Hanscomb Mikes background as the knowledgable kid, then reducing Mike to the 'black kid carrying the gun with the non-present parents' (granted theyre dead), really grated me bigtime.\n\nLet's not delve into how Muschietti also wants to turn Old-Mike into a junkie...",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"For everyone who didn't get the last joke where they look in the book to see who Beverly gets with, here's the explanation:\n\nThe kids decide they needed to strengthen their bonds to each other in order to defeat Pennywise after they get lost in the sewers and are starting to panic. So Beverly has sex with each of the boys one after the other. If that sounds weird, well, that's because it goddamn is weird. King has released a statement about it but I'm honestly not sure how much I believe what it says. \n\nI wasn’t really thinking of the sexual aspect of it. The book dealt with childhood and adulthood –1958 and Grown Ups. The grown ups don’t remember their childhood. None of us remember what we did as children–we think we do, but we don’t remember it as it really happened. Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again. The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood. It helps them remember what happened when they are called upon to fight again later on in life. It’s another version of the glass tunnel that connects the children’s library and the adult library. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now vastly more sensitivity to those issues. Stephen King, 2013",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"the only thing i really disagreed with was the joker point. Why not be both funny and scary, The new IT was both, the scene when he's eating an arm and then waves at mike,  The scene where  eddie broke is arm and IT uses his arm to smack himself with it was both funny and scary depending on who you talk to.",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"Ok so I did love and enjoy this video and the film, but as for why the fact that Pennywise is still funny, it works for him. Like be honest irl if a fucking clown started vainglorious ta you with a severed arm with a smile on his face, you'd be freaking out as well as thinking that wait this is bat shit nuts why aren't we laughing.",0,0
lLN1FwiqGwc,"Am I the only one who thinks that a good example of crappy effects was the projector scene? I'm mostly talking about when Pennywise pops out of the projector and attacks the kids, he's just so rubbery and fake looking there. When the woman turns into Pennywise, it looks fine, actually it looks great. But it's stuff like the projector attack, and the dance that makes me not take this film too seriously. not as silly as the miniseries, but still pretty silly.",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"i actually came up with a better plot for why she was taking and why they kept her alive that would follow the books better and make more sense. like show that he father was being controlled by it to give her a fear of something when she fights backing beating her fear it has to improvise and decides to take her thinking him showing himself is enough to make her afraid. back in the lair when it finds out she doesnt fear him he tries to transform into different things to make her afraid, random monsters but she lets it be known that no matter what it does to her the losers will stop him. so it gets a idea, believeing the losers are the source of her strength he tells her he will kill them one by one in front of her. this slowly makes her afraid since she fears for her new friends. it lets the kids know it has her using the bullies help. they come down all the crap happens and when they see her floating instead of a kiss waking her up the chubby one recites the poem. he tries to invoke a feeling out of her thats not a trope. the last bit with it fighting them pissed me off because it basically kids beating on a clown with a pipe. none of the mystical aspects of it showed or did he use his trademark fear other than changing what his face looks like. i would have fixed it by flooding the floor with the garbage acting as a type of island. the kids cant see it but hes using the water to hide and attack like how he did in the basement scene. in this scene he can turn into the different monsters even the shark one or zombies from earlier. the ending can be the same with it jumping out of the water to catch one of them and do the ill just take him scene. then realizing it is afraid of them empowers them. however after finding the dead kids and crazy parents being how they are the kids are forced to move afterward away from dairy. there was like 18 bodies floating down there some of them partially eating so yeah people fucking leave.",0,0
